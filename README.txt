Simple Landing Page, displaying the exact time in the following format (HH:MM:SS) am/pm. 
Then a greeting is shown, based on what time of the day it is followed by a window where you can insert
your name.

Following after this there is a question and again a window after it.
The answers given in the 2 windows is saved in local storage, use F12/Inspector to check and see this.

And the last line displays one fact about neurons. Based on the hour of the day it will display a different
fact. (I only put a few, not 24 facts).
